            <h3>Mansfield, PA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>In 1800, an English settler from Rhode Island named Asa Mann cleared a large amount of forest, and in 1804 laid out the plan for a town on this estate—Mann's field. The borough was incorporated in 1857. In the same year, the Mansfield Classical Seminary was founded, which became a state normal school in 1862 and is today Mansfield University of Pennsylvania.</p>
