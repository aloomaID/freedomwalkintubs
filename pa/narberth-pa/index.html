            <h3>Narberth, PA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Narberth is located on a parcel of land originally deeded to Edward Rees, which later became “Prees” and eventually “Price”, who arrived from Wales in 1682. A portion of this original tract became the 100-acre (0.40 km2) farm of Edward R. Price, who founded Elm as a Quaker-friendly town in 1881. The town name changed to Narberth in 1893, and Narberth was incorporated in 1895. In 1995, the borough celebrated its 100th birthday with a year-long celebration.</p>
