                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Indiana County (Indiana meaning 'land of the Indians') derives its name from the so-called 'Indiana Grant of 1768' that the Iroquois Six Nations were forced to make to 'suffering traders' under the Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1768. The Iroquois had controlled much of the Ohio River valley as their hunting grounds since the 17th century, and Anglo-American colonists were moving into the area and wanted to develop it. Traders arranged to force the Iroquois to grant land under the treaty in relations to losses due to Pontiac's Rebellion.</p>
