            <h3>Highspire, PA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>It is debated as to whether the town was named for the high spire of the church that could be seen from the Susquehanna River, or for the town in Bavaria where the original settlers and founders of the town were from. Either way, the town has a rich history of logging, the Pennsylvania canal system, candy, potato chips, whiskey, and hard working folks. It is a quaint little town nestled in between the towns of Steelton (home of the steel mill) and Middletown (where Harrisburg International Airport is located).</p>
