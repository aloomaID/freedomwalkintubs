                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>The name Kōloa is often incorrectly translated as 'native duck', which is the correct translation for the similar-looking koloa (without the macron). Kōloa means 'a long cane with a crook.' According to one account, the district of Kōloa was named for a steep rock called Pali-o-kō-loa which was found in Waikomo Stream.</p>
