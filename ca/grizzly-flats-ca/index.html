            <h3>Grizzly Flats, CA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Grizzly Flats originated as a gold mining camp in the 1850s. The name was given by prospectors who were surprised by a grizzly bear there in 1850. In 1852 it was described as being on a flat piece of land measuring approximately one mile by three quarters of a mile and having two combination bars, stores, and boarding houses, with more under construction. It was located centrally in a jurisdiction called Mountain Township. A post office opened in 1854, a stagecoach route to Diamond Springs in 1855, and a Wells Fargo office in 1857. Catholic and Methodist churches were also established in the mid-1850s.</p>
