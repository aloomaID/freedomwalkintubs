Increased Home Value<br>Installing a walk-in tub can be an excellent investment, especially for homeowners in River Rouge Michigan  looking to make their homes more attractive to potential buyers. Many buyers today are looking for homes with modern, accessible features, and a walk-in tub adds both functionality and luxury to your bathroom.<br>4.
