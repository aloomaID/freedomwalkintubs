            <h3>Eastpointe, MI Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>The community was first settled by Irish and German immigrants in the 1830s. In October 1897, a post office was established there with the name of 'Half-way', as it was near the halfway point of the stage run between downtown Detroit and the Macomb County seat at Mount Clemens. It incorporated as the village of Halfway in December 1924 and reincorporated as the city of East Detroit in January 1929. Prior to 1924, most of the community formed a part of Erin Township. The city changed its name to 'Eastpointe' after the change was approved by residents in a 1992 referendum; the name change had been proposed to remove any perceived association with the adjacent city of Detroit; the 'pointe' suffix is intended to associate the city instead with the nearby affluent communities of the Grosse Pointes.</p>
