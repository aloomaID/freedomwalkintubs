            <h3>Gladwin, MI Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Gladwin county is named for Henry Gladwin, a British military commander at Detroit during Pontiac's War. The county was named in 1831 and organized in 1875. Gladwin had its beginnings in 1875 during the Michigan lumber boom. Situated on the Cedar River, the city was named Cedar until it was discovered that another Michigan town shared the same name. Thereafter, the city was named after the county. The first church in Gladwin was a Methodist church completed on March 31, 1878. In the Fall of 1878, the first schoolhouse was built by Isaac Hanna, later being replaced by a four-room schoolhouse in 1883. Gladwin was incorporated as a village in 1885.</p>
