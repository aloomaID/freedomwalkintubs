                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Loxahatchee Groves is a town in Palm Beach County, Florida, United States. The town was incorporated November 1, 2006, as the 38th municipality in Palm Beach County. The first election for town council members was held on March 13, 2007. The area had been settled since 1917, although Loxahatchee Groves did not become a municipality until 2006. The town bills itself as 'Florida's Last Frontier'. It was incorporated primarily in order to protect the area from the encroaching urbanization of South Florida, as nearby cities continued to develop and to preserve the area's rural character. The town is part of the Miami metropolitan area. As of the 2020 US census, the town had a population of 3,355.</p>
