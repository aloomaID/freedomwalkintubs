            <h3>Lake Lorraine, FL Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Lake Lorraine is a census-designated place (CDP) in Okaloosa County, Florida, United States. The population was 7,106 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Fort Walton Beach–Crestview–Destin Metropolitan Statistical Area. It carries a Shalimar postal address and zip code. Lake Lorraine was originally a fresh-water body, but at some point in the 1990s the narrow sandbar that separated it from the Choctawhatchee Bay was breached and the former drainage channel to the tip of Black's Point became blocked by silt.</p>
